Flu Shot Learning: Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines - [HOSTED BY DRIVENDATA](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/)

Predicting H1N1 and Seasonal Flu vaccine acceptance based on individual personality traits and variables. Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.

Programmed in R Markdown. Achieved top 11% out of 4000+ participants.

Implemented machine learning algorithms which comprises of:
1. Logistic Regression, 
2. Naive Bayes, and
3. Gradient Boosting Machine.

Included in the project are 
- exploratory data analysis, 
- preprocessing, 
- feature selection using statistical methods, 
- modelling,
- model evaluation, and
- results presentation and comparison
